  const readingPassage = `Language learning is a fascinating journey that transforms not just how we communicate, but how we think and perceive the world around us. When we learn a new language, we aren't simply memorizing vocabulary and grammar rules; we're adopting new cultural frameworks and perspectives.

Research has shown that bilingual and multilingual individuals often demonstrate enhanced cognitive abilities. They typically exhibit better problem-solving skills, improved memory, and greater mental flexibility. This "cognitive reserve" even appears to delay the onset of dementia symptoms in older adults.

Beyond the cognitive benefits, language learning opens doors to new cultures, literature, and human connections that would otherwise remain inaccessible. It allows us to engage with people from different backgrounds on a deeper level, fostering empathy and cross-cultural understanding.

In today's interconnected global society, language skills are increasingly valuable in the job market. Employers often seek candidates who can communicate with international clients, partners, and colleagues. This skill can lead to better job opportunities and higher earning potential.

The journey of language acquisition is not without challenges. It requires persistence, patience, and a willingness to make mistakes. Many learners experience plateaus or periods of frustration. However, these challenges are part of the process, and overcoming them leads to greater fluency and confidence.

Modern technology has revolutionized how we learn languages. Mobile apps, online courses, and language exchange platforms make it easier than ever to practice consistently and connect with native speakers from anywhere in the world.

Ultimately, language learning is more than an academic pursuitâ€”it's a lifelong adventure that enriches our experiences and broadens our horizons in countless ways.`;
